# Regular Grammar Parser

This project is a Python-based tool for parsing regular grammars, converting them into Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA), and validating strings against the generated NFA. It also includes a visualizer to render the NFA as a graph.

## Features

- Parse regular grammar rules.
- Convert grammar into an NFA.
- Validate strings against the NFA.
- Visualize the NFA using Graphviz.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `graphviz` library (for NFA visualization)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hassaankh10/Regular_Grammar_Parser
   cd Regular_Grammar_Parser
